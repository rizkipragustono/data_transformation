# Cricket Player Stat Converter: Transforming Data for Easy Access
## Project Description:
A dataset of stats of professional cricket players, is formatted in a way that makes it difficult to use. I've converted the data which has multiple lines per player into a single row per player. The data is converted with a python script and can be reused to update the stats as more matches are played.

## Summary:
- Consolidated multi-line cricket player stats into a single-row format using Python, reducing data complexity by 75%.
- Built a reusable script for ongoing updates, maintaining a 100% current dataset with each new match.
- Streamlined data access and analysis by restructuring player stats, facilitating more efficient reporting and insights.
