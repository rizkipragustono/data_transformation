# Automated Data Transformation for Cricket Player Stats: Single-Row Conversion and Seamless Updates
## Project Description:
A dataset of stats of professional cricket players, is formatted in a way that makes it difficult to use. I've converted the data which has multiple lines per player into a single row per player. The data is converted with a python script and can be reused to update the stats as more matches are played.
